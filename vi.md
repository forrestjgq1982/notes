## Modify

### Basic operation
Keys | Action
---- | -------------------------------------------------
i    | insert before curr cursor
I    | insert before non-blank head of line
a    | append after curr cursor
A    | append after eol
c    | change some object or motion

guu  | lower case whole line
gUU  | upper case whole line
g~~  | revert case whole line


hint:
> {n}i/I/a/A{edit}{esc} will repeat the whole editing

### Short cut
keys | refers to | action
---- | --------- | --------------------------------------
s    | cl        | change current char
S    | cc        | change whole line
C    | c$        | change to eol
x    | dl        | delete current char
X    | dh        | delete prev char
D    | d$        | delete to eol


### Automation

macro recording actually put all actions into register as text,
so when you put it with "{c}p you will see the command sequence.

as a matter of fact, you may also yank command sequence to register,
then directly play it with @{c} without recording.

the only problem is that you may not be able to enter {esc} as char.
but it can be achieved by {C-V}{esc}.

Keys    | Action
------- | -------------------------------------
q{c}    | start macro recording to register {c}
q       | end macro recording
{n}@{c} | play recorded macro at register {c}
{n}@@   | repeat previous @{c}

### External Program
Filter text with external program:
>!{motion}{program}

this will filter text from current line to the line {motion} locates with {program}.

To filter current line only, use:
>!!{program}

For exsample, input:
```
!!wc vi.md
```

the current line will be replaces as:
```
 457  2503 15213 vi.md
```
 
### Commands

 cmd              | action
 -------          | ------------------------------------
 {r}m[ove] {addr} | move {r} lines below {addr}

**examples:**

reverse all lines:
> :g/^/m 0

## Search and Replace
### Operations
For search, the operations are:

Keys       | Action
---------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------
\*, #      | search forward/backward for word under cursor, match exact words
g\* ,g#    | search forward/backward for word under cursor, not match exact words
/pattern   | search forwards
?pattern   | search backwards
/{cr}      | repeat searching forwards
?{cr}      | repeat searching backwards
n/N        | repeat in same/opposite direction
{n}f{ch}   | search forward next occurrence of {ch} in line
{n}F{ch}   | search backward next occurrence of {ch} in line
{n}t{ch}   | search forward the char before f
{n}T{ch}   | search backward the char after F
;          | repeat previous finding in same direction
,          | repeat previous finding in opposite direction

For replacement, the operations are:

Keys | Action
---- | -----------------------------------------------------------------
{n}r | replace a char without enter insert mode
R    | enter replace mode and replace one by one until ESC
{n}s | similar as r, but it delete a few chars and enter insert mode
{n}S | delete few lines and enter insert mode
S    | replace while line, keep it emtpy

hint:
>believe or not, {n}r == {n}R if only one char is replaced

### Commands
commands for searching:

Command    | Action
---------- | -------------------------
/pattern   | search forwards
?pattern   | search backwards
/{cr}      | repeat searching forwards
?{cr}      | repeat searching backwards

commands for substitution:
> :{r}s/old/new/[gcpe]

here '/' is the delim to seperate command parts, but it can be any
char else, so the next command is also legal:
> :{r}s@old@new@[gcpe]

word matching:
- "\\\>" matches the end of the word in searching, so ***/the\\\>*** will search for the word end with 'the' only, and will not match 'there', but "soothe" is a legal match.
- similarly, "\\\<" will match the start of a word, so "/\\\<the\\\>" will match the word "the" only


{r} can be :
- a single line {line} or line range {line},{line}
- line can be '.' for current, '$' for last, '1' for first, or specified line number like 45
- % for global, that is 1,$
- a pattern search, like g/pattern/s/old/new/g, if the first 'g' is not given the pattern will match the first matching, other than global search
- a pattern range, like /pattern/,/pattern/, or use % instead / for backward search
- pattern or line can take offset like /pattern/+1 or /pattern/-2, or $-2
- global match pattern and only replace in the matched lines
- a mark range like 't,'b or '\<,'\>

reg pattern:
- \\\* for 0 or more
- \\\(, \\\) for group
- \\+ for one or more
- \\= for zero or more
- \\{m,n} or \\{m} for repeat for range, m or n can be absent
- \\| for alternatives
- [] for char range, in which 
    + \\e for {esc}
    + \\t for {Tab}
    + \\r for {cr} 
    + \\b for {BS}
    + \\n for {LF} ???
    + see help /[] for more
- predefined ranges:
    + \d for digit
    + \x for hex digit
    + \s for white space
    + \l for lowercase alpha
    + \u for uppercase alpha
    + all ranges as capital of above add '^' of range
    + see help /\s for more
