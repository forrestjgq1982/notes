### Automation

macro recording actually put all actions into register as text,
so when you put it with "<c>p you will see the command sequence.

as a matter of fact, you may also yank command sequence to register,
then directly play it with @<c> without recording.

the only problem is that you may not be able to enter <esc> as char.
but it can be achieved by <C-V><esc>.

Keys    | Action
------- | -------------------------------------
q<c>    | start macro recording to register <c>
q       | end macro recording
<n>@<c> | play recorded macro at register <c>
<n>@@   | repeat previous @<c>

## Search and Replace
### Operations
For search, the operations are:

Keys       | Action
---------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------
\*, #      | search forward/backward for word under cursor, match exact words
g\* ,g#    | search forward/backward for word under cursor, not match exact words
/pattern   | search forwards
?pattern   | search backwards
/<cr>      | repeat searching forwards
?<cr>      | repeat searching backwards
n/N        | repeat in same/opposite direction
<n>f<ch>   | search forward next occurrence of <ch> in line
<n>F<ch>   | search backward next occurrence of <ch> in line
<n>t<ch>   | search forward the char before f
<n>T<ch>   | search backward the char after F
;          | repeat previous finding in same direction
,          | repeat previous finding in opposite direction

For replacement, the operations are:

Keys | Action
---- | -----------------------------------------------------------------
<n>r | replace a char without enter insert mode
R    | enter replace mode and replace one by one until ESC
<n>s | similar as r, but it delete a few chars and enter insert mode
<n>S | delete few lines and enter insert mode
S    | replace while line, keep it emtpy

hint:
>believe or not, <n>r == <n>R if only one char is replaced

### Commands
commands for searching:

Command    | Action
---------- | -------------------------
/pattern   | search forwards
?pattern   | search backwards
/<cr>      | repeat searching forwards
?<cr>      | repeat searching backwards

commands for substitution:
> :<r>s/old/new/[gcp]

here '/' is the delim to seperate command parts, but it can be any
char else, so the next command is also legal:
> :<r>s@old@new@[gcp]

word matching:
- "\>" matches the end of the word in searching, so ***/the\>*** will search for the word end with 'the' only, and will not match 'there', but "soothe" is a legal match.
- similarly, "\<" will match the start of a word, so "/\<the\>" will match the word "the" only


<r> can be :
- a single line <line> or line range <line>,<line>
- line can be '.' for current, '$' for last, '1' for first, or specified line number like 45
- % for global, that is 1,$
- a pattern search, like g/pattern/s/old/new/g, if the first 'g' is not given the pattern will match the first matching, other than global search
- a pattern range, like /pattern/,/pattern/, or use % instead / for backward search
- pattern or line can take offset like /pattern/+1 or /pattern/-2, or $-2
- global match pattern and only replace in the matched lines
- a mark range like 't,'b or '<,'>

### Global command
execute command on global matched pattern:
> :[range]global/{pattern}/{command}
